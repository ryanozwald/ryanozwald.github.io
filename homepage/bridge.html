  <h1>The Blue Bridge</h1>

<!--Bridge Poem-->
    <pre>
    How simple you look,
    Sitting there over your reflection.
    People walking over you every day,
    Your minds have not crossed once.


    Some have rituals to bring each other together on you,
    They may jump off, or ride down your steep hill.
    You give us something we can share and enjoy,
    Some adrenaline, some excitement, some escape.


    Through the seasons, your uses change,
    The neighbor may take their kid down to sled you down.
    When our celebration of independence comes,
    Fireworks are sent up in the dark sky off of you.


    I can see why you want to be here though,
    They may not love you, and abuse you;
    But you're joy when you see another child cross.
    Without you, he couldn’t escape,
    Stay stuck in this small hole of peace and curiosity,
    when he wants is the insane roar of the city.


    The sun soon begins to pass, and the sky becomes beautiful colors,
    the fisherman come out, and cast their hooks into the water,
    following the glitter of the fishes scales,
    all to catch one and keep it in their list of memories on you.
    The sky soon darkens, they pack their boxes and head home to tell about what they’ve achieved,


    The devious teens come out and inhale the ashes they burn.
    Do they want to escape from their older one's control?
    Do they want to fit in with who they are with?
    or do they want to escape from this hole into their realities?
    Why won’t anything satisfy them anymore,
    Why is it only these rolled addictions that cure them?


    Proposals have been said on you,
    Dates have gone on their first night together on you,
    Families have walked together on you,
    But, what makes you so special?
    I mean, New York has many bridges to itself,
    And they share these same qualities.


    They are filled with mindless tourists,
    ungrateful, and spoiled brats,
    Instagram “Influencers,”
    The people think they can “change the world.”




    I come to you, as
    You are more than a bridge,
    You let me escape,
    You take me to society,
    You bridge my worlds together,
    You are humane, kind, admirable.
    You are my New York City

    - Ryan
